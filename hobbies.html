      One of my favorite hobbies is film photography. I really enjoy the whole
      process, from loading a roll of film, to shooting it, then developing it,
      and then scanning it. Currently I do not develop my own film but that is
      something I plan on doing in the near future. I really enjoy finally
      getting to see my photos once they are uploaded to an online album. There
      is so much anticipation because I dont get to see my photots right after I
      took, I have to wait. Its a good feeling seeing a properly exposed photo
      knowing I metered the light correctlty. I am having so much fun go out and
      about using different film stocks and learning what each one has to offer.
      Photography has been an so much fun to learn and will continue this hobby
      into my old age.

    <h2><b>Playing guitar</b></h2>
    <p>
      Playing guitar is another hobby i have. This hobby goes as far back as
      elementry school and is something ive kept up with over the years. I
      started really taking it serious in high school and would often hang out
      with other friends who played instruments and jam out. I even eventually
      formed my own band with a bunch of friends and would hang out on fridays
      and play our favorite songs. This has been such a great outlet to express
      myself and will continue to play for the rest of my life.
